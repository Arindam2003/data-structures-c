## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find implementations of various data structures from Basic question (like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs) and algorithms (including sorting, searching, and dynamic programming). Each implementation is designed to be educational and easily understandable.

## Features

- Comprehensive implementations of basic and advanced data structures.
- Solutions to common algorithmic problems.
- Well-commented code to help you learn.
- Examples and test cases to demonstrate usage.

## Problem Solved

This repository includes solutions to the following DSA problems:

<!-- 1. **Binary Search** - Efficiently searching in a sorted array.
2. **Merge Sort** - A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)** - Traversing a graph using recursion.
4. **Dynamic Programming** - Solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci sequence). --->

<!-- *(Add more problems youâ€™ve solved as necessary)* -->

<!-- ## Technologies Used

- Programming Languages: C
- Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs
